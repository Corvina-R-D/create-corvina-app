# create corvina app #

Setup a corvina web app in one command!

The template generated by this command is tested and supported by the Corvina team. It is a good starting point for building a web app that can be embedded in the Corvina platform.

> **Note:** We test the app template generated by this command on the following platforms:
>
> - Ubuntu 20+
> - macOS 11+
> - Windows 11 with WSL2

## Usage ##

You can create a new corvina web app by running the following command:

```bash
npx @corvina/create-corvina-app@latest webapp
```

This will prompt you to select a name for your app, and then create a new directory called `corvina-app-{name}`. Inside the directory, it will generate the initial project structure.

The basic structure of the project is as follows:

```bash
corvina-app-{name}
├── README.md # all the instruction to run and develop the app
├── docker-compose.yaml
├── /app # frontend application written in vuejs and typescript
│   ├── package.json
|   ├── Dockerfile
│   ├── /src
│   ├── ...
├── /service # backend service written in nestjs and typescript
│   ├── package.json
|   ├── Dockerfile
│   ├── /src
│   ├── ...
├── /helm-charts # helm charts for the service and the app for local development and for deploying in corvina kubernetes cluster
│   ├── /corvina-app-{name}
│   │   ├── Chart.yaml
│   │   ├── values.yaml
│   │   ├── templates
│   │   ├── ...
```

You can also create the app without prompting:

```bash
npx @corvina/create-corvina-app@latest webapp --name myapp --kubernetes
```

### Meaning of helm charts ###

The helm charts are used to deploy the application in a kubernetes cluster. The `corvina-app-{name}` chart is used to deploy the application in the Corvina platform. We provide this structure as an example of how we build and deploy our applications in Corvina. You can use this structure as a starting point for your own application or you can use your own structure (there is no need to deploy on kubernetes).

We use to develop our application usign minikube on our laptop. For that reason, at the root of the project, you will find some scripts to help you:

- ./start-all-locally.minikube.sh: starts all the stuff you need to run the app locally (postgresql, redis, service, app and istio ingress)
- ./install-certificate-locally.sh: installs the certificate for the app locally (you need to run this script after running the previous one)
- ./cleanup.minikube.sh: delete all the resources created by ./start-all-locally.minikube.sh
